# Healthcare Translation Web App Documentation

## Project Overview

The Healthcare Translation Web App is a real-time multilingual translation tool designed to facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients who speak different languages. Built with React and powered by OpenAI's AI models, this application converts spoken input into text, enhances medical terminology, provides accurate translations, and offers audio playback capabilities.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Functional Components, Hooks)
- **Speech Recognition:** Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition interface)
- **Translation & Enhancement:** OpenAI GPT-4
- **Text-to-Speech:** Web Speech API (SpeechSynthesis interface)
- **State Management:** React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- **Storage:** Browser's localStorage API
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Package Management:** Yarn

## AI Integration

### Speech Recognition
The application leverages the browser's native SpeechRecognition API to:
- Capture continuous audio input
- Process interim and final speech results
- Adjust to different source languages
- Handle recognition errors gracefully

### AI-Powered Enhancement and Translation
The app uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model for two critical functions:

1. **Medical Transcript Enhancement:**
   ```javascript
   // From translationService.js
   export async function enhanceTranscript(transcript, language) {
     // OpenAI API call with system prompt:
     // "You are a medical terminology specialist. 
     // Correct any misheard or misspelled medical terms..."
   }
   ```

2. **Specialized Medical Translation:**
   ```javascript
   // From translationService.js
   export async function translateText(text, sourceLanguage, targetLanguage) {
     // OpenAI API call with system prompt:
     // "You are a medical translator specialized in healthcare terminology.
     // Translate the following text from [source] to [target]..."
   }
   ```

### Development with Claude 3.7 Sonnet
Claude 3.7 Sonnet was used during development for:
- Debugging complex code issues
- Optimizing API integration
- Refining prompts for OpenAI's medical translation and enhancement

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the application locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.0.0 or later)
- **Yarn** (v1.22.0 or later)
- A modern web browser that supports the Web Speech API (Chrome recommended)
- An OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/etienne-tov/healthcare-translation-app.git
   cd healthcare-translation-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```
   REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```
   
   > **Important:** Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

5. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Troubleshooting Local Setup

#### Web Speech API Issues
- The application requires microphone access - ensure you grant permission when prompted
- If you encounter SpeechRecognition errors:
  - Verify your browser supports the Web Speech API (Chrome is recommended)
  - Check that your microphone is working properly
  - Try using a headset for better speech recognition

#### API Key Issues
- If translations fail, check that your OpenAI API key is:
  - Valid and not expired
  - Has access to GPT-4
  - Is correctly entered in your `.env.local` file
  - Has sufficient usage quota remaining

#### Browser Compatibility
The application is optimized for:
- Google Chrome (recommended)
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox (may have limited speech recognition support)
- Safari (requires additional configuration for speech recognition)

## Testing

### Local Testing

To verify the application is working correctly:

1. **Speech Recognition Test:**
   - Select source language (e.g., English)
   - Click the microphone button
   - Speak a simple phrase
   - Verify the text appears in the "Original" panel

2. **Translation Test:**
   - Select target language (e.g., Spanish)
   - Record a medical term or phrase
   - Wait for translation to appear
   - Verify the translation is accurate

3. **Text-to-Speech Test:**
   - After a successful translation
   - Click the speaker icon
   - Verify audio playback of the translated text

4. **History Test:**
   - Complete several translations
   - Click "View History"
   - Verify previous translations are displayed
   - Select a history item and verify it loads correctly

### Browser Console
Monitor the browser's developer console (F12) for:
- API errors
- Speech recognition status
- Translation service responses

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. Open the application in a web browser
2. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
3. Select your language from the "I speak" dropdown
4. Select the target language from the "Translate to" dropdown

### Recording and Translation
1. Click the microphone button to begin recording
2. Speak clearly into your device's microphone
3. View your speech in the "Original" panel as you speak
4. The application will:
   - Process your speech in real-time
   - Enhance medical terminology
   - Translate the content to the target language
5. When finished, click the microphone button again to stop recording

### Using Translations
1. Review the translated text in the "Translation" panel
2. Click the speaker icon to hear the translation spoken aloud
3. Use the "Clear All" button to reset both panels for a new conversation

### Translation History
1. Click "View History" to see previous translations
2. Select any past translation to load it into the main interface
3. Use the "Clear History" button to remove all saved translations

## Security and Privacy

- **No Server Storage:** Patient data is not stored on external servers
- **Local-Only Storage:** Translation history is saved only on the user's device
- **Secure API Communication:** All API calls use HTTPS encryption
- **Environment Variables:** API keys are secured and not exposed in client-side code
- **Privacy Notice:** Users are informed that speech data is processed securely

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment
The application is deployed on Vercel, which provides:
- Continuous integration with the GitHub repository
- Automatic HTTPS encryption
- Environment variable management
- Global CDN for fast access worldwide

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Install Vercel CLI (if deploying from local):
   ```bash
   yarn global add vercel
   ```

2. Connect to Vercel from command line:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy the application:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   - Set `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY` in the Vercel dashboard
   - Or configure during deployment when prompted

5. Set production deployment:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```


## Performance Optimization

- **API Call Optimization:** Transcript enhancement only triggers on final results
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- **Loading States:** Visual feedback during processing
- **Resource Management:** Speech recognition services are properly initialized and destroyed

## Limitations and Future Improvements

- **Browser Compatibility:** Full functionality depends on browser support for SpeechRecognition API
- **Language Coverage:** Currently supports major languages, but could be expanded
- **Medical Specialization:** Future versions could include specialty-specific medical terminology
- **Offline Support:** Enhanced offline functionality could be implemented
- **User Accounts:** Optional accounts for secure cross-device history
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Enable multiple healthcare providers to join sessions

## Conclusion

The Healthcare Translation Web App demonstrates how AI technology can be leveraged to improve communication in healthcare settings. By combining speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech capabilities, the application reduces language barriers between patients and providers, potentially improving healthcare outcomes and experiences.
